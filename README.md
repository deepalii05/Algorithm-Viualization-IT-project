Along with the mathematical and factual study of algorithms, there is another, more intriguing, way to study algorithms, which is Algorithm Visualization. This is a visual illustration of an algorithm’s operation, of its performance on different kinds of inputs (size of input, e.g. Arrays), or of its execution speed versus that of other algorithms for the same problem. An algorithm visualization consists of graphic elements—points, line segments, two- or three-dimensional bars, colors of different input elements, etc. to showcase what is exactly going on in an Algorithm. Algorithms and data structures form one cornerstone of an undergraduate computer science education. A technique for improving instruction in this critical area is to bring Algorithm Visualization into the picture. It brings algorithms to life by graphically representing their various states and animating the transitions between those states. They illustrate data structures in abstract, intuitive ways instead of focusing on memory addresses and function calls. Teaching, Exploring and Debugging can be done with Algorithm Visualization.
