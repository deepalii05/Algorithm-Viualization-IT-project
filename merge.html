    <h1>MERGE SORT</h1>
    <p>Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm .It is based on the idea of dividing the unsorted array into several sub-array and until each sub-array consists of a single element and merging those sub-array in such a way that results into a sorted aray.The process step of merge sort can be summarized as follows: </p>
    <div class="Process steps:">
        <h2>Process steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <ul>
                <li>Divide:Divide the unsorted array into several sub-array until each sub-array contains only single element.</li>
                <li>Merge:Merge the sub-arrays in such way that results into sorted array and merge until achieves the original array.</li>
                <li>Merging technique:The first element of the two sub-arrays is considered and compared.For ascending order sorting,the element with the smaller value is taken from the sub-array and becomes a new element of the sorted array. This process is repeated until both sub-array are emptied and the merged array becomes sorted array.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h3>EXAMPLE:</h3>
    <p>To understand the merge sort ,lets consider an unsorted array[4,9,-4] and discuss each step taken to sort the array in ascending order.</p>
    <p>At the first step,the array[4,9,-4] is divided into two sub-array contains[4,9] and second sub-array contains[-4].As the number of element in the first sub-array is greater than one,it is further divided into sub-arrays conditiong of elements [4][9]respectively.As the number of elements in all sub-arrays is one ,hence the further dividing of the array can not be done.</p>
    <p>In the merging process, the sub-arrays formed in the last step are combined together using the process mentioned above to form a sorted array.First,[4]and [9] sub-arrays are merged together to form a sorted sub-array [4,9].Then [4,9] and [-4] sub-arrays are merged together to form final sorted array[-4,4,9].  </p>
